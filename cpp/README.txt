Third-party libraries:

* OptParse, version 0.2; starting link:

    <http://optparse.sourceforge.net/>

  LIMITATIONS: doesn't support specifying a target variable for the options.
               Makes it difficult to have default values *and* avoid code
               duplication at the same time.
               IMHO, Boost.Program_options is a superior choice in this
               regard, at the cost of more complexity in the library code.

        has been incorporated into the serclient project.
